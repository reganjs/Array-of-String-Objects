# Array-of-String-Objects
Write a program that creates an array of 100 string objects. Fill the array by having your program open a (text) file and read one line of the file into each string until you have filled the array. Display the array using the format “line #: &lt;string>,” where # is the actual line number (you can use the array counter for this value) and &lt;string> is the stored string.
